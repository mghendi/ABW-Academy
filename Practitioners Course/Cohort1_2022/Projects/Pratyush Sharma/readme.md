In the recently published National Family Health Survey of India, it's been discovered that there is a high prevalence of Anemia in the district; about half of the population in Guna is Anaemic. This statistic is alarming and the district administration is working towards eradicating the iron deficiency by launching additional intiatives along with the central and state programs already being delivered in the district. The initiatives are being delivered through the already existing public healthcare facilities in the district.

#### Goal of the project
The project aims at mapping the current status of healthcare facilities in the district of Guna which will assist in planning and implementing healthcare interventions in the district. Mapping will also help to identify and plan for minimizing the gaps that exist in the availability and accessibility of critical healthcare services.

#### Who will be using the results of this project and for making what decisions?
The results of the project will be provided to the Transforming Rural India Foundation (TRIF) India, a non-profit organization working towards the betterment of quality of life of the people at the bottom of the pyramid. TRIF works in the areas of livelihood, agriculture, healthcare and skill development. The results of the project would help the organization with important insights on the healthcare facilities' distribution in the district and will help to plan the project interventions in the district.

#### Expected Deliverables
The project plans to visualize the overall distribution of the healthcare facilities in the district. The healthcare facilities are required to be mapped against the population catchment area revealing scope of new infrastructure and important junctures with respect to the optimal service delivery. The mapping exercise should be designed to collect this information and allow the district officials to take stock of current capacity and gaps.
