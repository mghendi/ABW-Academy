## Re-establishing an efficient supply chain for WFP in Haiti

#### Background information

Subject to numerous natural disasters such as earthquakes (2010, 2021) and hurricanes (2016, 2018, 2021), the production and the sustainable access to food has been a challenge in Haiti for the past decades. In addition to these events, the death of the last president in 2021 has lead the country in another period of political instability. 

Since September 2022, with the lock of the fuel terminal and the major demonstrations which occurred all around the country, the Haitians have entered in a new period of Peyi Lok and have seen their access to fuel and food drastically challenged. This situation led to a dramatic increase in food insecurity and, for the first time in the country, to the apparition of IPC 5 population (catastrophe level). 

During this crisis period, the World Food Programme (WFP) has attempted to help the population by providing food and financial help to the most vulnerable. Nevertheless, these activities have been largely limited by the multiple demonstrations constraining the movements in the country and more importantly, by the looting and 2 of its warehouses (Gonaives and Les Cayes). These lootings lead to the lost of close to 1300mt of food and more importantly, to the loss of 2 main depots, used in all its operations. 

In order to cope with this new situation, WFP is currently working on the reorganization of its supply chain in order to both mitigate the loss of its warehouses and also adapt to the new IPC report and be able to quickly access the most vulnerable populations in order to provide financial and food support. 

#### Goal of the project

The goal of this project consists in attempting to retrieve different cost and demand information in order to develop an optimization model studying different scenarios of supply chain reorganization. The output of this model would help WFP Haiti management to identify the potential reallocation of resources for the supply chain and define the optimal supply chain for the coming months and years.

#### Who will be using the results of this project and for making what decisions?

Identify at least 2 collaborators :
  • Emilie Dufour, Head of Supply Chain, WFP Haiti. Emilie will help to better assess the elements to consider in the mathematical model in order to have a comprehensive model which matches with WFP’s needs.
  •	Marina Romiti, Head of Program, WFP Haiti. In this project, Marina will help to provide information in terms of distribution of the demand in the coming months and year to create demand scenarios that match the needs of the population and in order to develop a supply chain which move the food closer to the beneficiaries.

#### Expected Deliverables

As deliverable, a report will be developed. In this report, the data inputs, the demand scenarios and the proposed mathematical model will be listed. Moreover, if the time constraints allow it, the mathematical model will be implemented to study the first scenarios and provide preliminary results for the study.
