#### Background information
The demand for the provision of innovative Image Analysis and Image Intelligence Service (hear after IMINT Service) in the United Nations has been drastically growing in support of decision-making processes for effective UN operations in the field and at UNHQ. It is related to the missionsâ€™ requirements to enhance operations and provide capabilities for monitoring and situational awareness. In the UNHQ this demand is focusing on the provision of evidence of various events in the area of UN interests; provision of various analysis and assessments for reporting, planning, and decision-making processes. 				 

The UN is utilising Image Analysis and Image Interpretation Services provided by the GIS Programmes on ad-hoc bases since 2000. During the consolidation of GIS recourses in GSC in 2014, the Analytics and Location Intelligence Unit - ALIU  was established to fulfill the demand of Spatial, Terrain, and Environmental Analysis as a centralized service in UNGSC. UNGSC provided a variety of on/off line products developed and implemented by an experienced team in the areas of Remote Sensing, Spatial Analysis and Earth Science on a robust infrastructure. Their products help predict flooding, assess damage, identify safe locations for camps in the missions, assess the security risk associated with terrorism and war, aiding in the safety of our colleagues, detect near-surface utilities, discover mass graves, and identify drilling targets in order to ensure water supply in the Field. 

#### Goal of the project

The goal of the project is to find out how GeoAI/ deep learning can be used to extract features, through application of AI (CNN), for segmentation of medium resolution Satellite imagery e.g Sentinel. These features could be roads, schools, camps or other features of interest for humanitarian purposes. The objective is to establish a workflow that can be used effectively to support the UN/NGO field missions.

#### Who will be using the results of this project and for making what decisions?

These results are useful especially where the imagery is not updated oftenly, and the existing imagery cannot be used to see the features. Artificial Intelligence models can extract features, which cannot be seen by naked eyes. These models can be run oftenly, and if new features are avaiable, they can be updated. This is important for humanitarian purposes.
