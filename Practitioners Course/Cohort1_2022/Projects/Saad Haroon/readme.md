## Rutgers Fundraising Dashboard

#### Background information

I work in the fundraising department of Rutgers and our main mission is to generate funding to scale up and expand our work at the international level. Rutgers does not have a data analytics team or in-house capacity for expert data analytics. 
Rutgers has kept a track record of our fundraising efforts and donor profiles. For examples we keep a data base in excel on the proposal that we submit each other and the relevant donor profile against a proposal. However, the data in excel is sometimes too scattered or it is very difficult to get a better picture of how successful we have been in our fundraising.


#### Goal of the project

Through Power BI, I want to create a dashboard(s) that can better analyse and  visualise the data we have on excel on our proposal submissions in the past years and donor profiles. My goal is that Power BI can offer a better picture of what has happened over the past years. Where have we been successful, and where haven’t been successful. And it might also give a better analysis of donor demographics, trends and focus areas. And other unknown aspects of donor data to create an in-depth understanding of our donor network. This can help us to effectively strategise our future fund-raising efforts.  I’m also expecting Power BI to help me discover hidden relationships or patterns that point to new openings towards future fundraising.

#### Who will be using the results of this project and for making what decisions?

Henk Rolink, Head of Resource Mobilisation Team, will collaborate with me on this project. Henk will guide me and advise me on what we want to get out of this project and what elements of our fundraising efforts do we want to visualise. I named only one collaborator because there is only me and Henk in the Resource Mobilisation team who will work closely on this. Other than that, the outcomes of this project will be presented to the leadership and other relevant teams as well

#### Expected Deliverables

A dashboard which gives us a clear picture of our past fundraising efforts in light of the proposal that we submitted. With which donor have we been successful and where have we not. What is the trend of our fundraising and which donor profiles suit us. Also can we also forecast or strategise our future fundraising on the basis of this analysis?
