## AI for Optimizing Plastic Waste Collection in Nairobi, Kenya

#### Background information

50% of the world’s population inhabit cities and this number is expected to reach 70% by 2050 as more people migrate to urban centres for opportunities. In any organized environment, as systems become more complex there is a tendency to move towards disorganization. Garbage pollution is an effect of the complexity imposed by increased population in urban areas. Unlike our animal counterparts, human beings generate waste that is both too immense in scale and variability for nature to keep up. In Kenya, solid waste accounts for roughly 35-40 million tons of all waste produced each year, 42% of which consists of plastic. Plastics emits gases that are poisonous to breathe when incinerated, and due to their non-biodegradable nature, recycling is considered the foremost solution to ensure they do not end up polluting the atmosphere, the soil or water sources. Advances in cross-cutting disciplines such as artificial intelligence and data analytics offer the promise to solve mankind’s biggest challenges and push the limits to provide approachable solutions. 

#### Goal of the project

With the existing methods of collection, waste management will become near impossible to manage in Kenya. And if counter-active approaches are not taken early, additional build up will occur on and along roads, landfills, rivers and water systems, and public spaces due to ineffective disposing and collecting methods. The prime impediment of implementing other smart waste systems that require hardware implementation in a developing country lies the countries’ social and economic infrastructure. The proposed method suggests establishing a data science tool for establishing collection points, routing plastic waste collection, and mapping dumpsites and passable road networks that will fit into a larger system that also includes credit scoring for incentives.

#### Who will be using the results of this project and for making what decisions?

Internal stakeholders, scientists working on plastics, and external stakeholders, entreprenuers and county residents who need to provide and access plastic waste collection services efficiently respectively.

Identify atleast 2 collaborators from your organization who will support you by providing
- Saiful Ridwan, Chief - Information Systems, Enterprise Solutions Section - Corporate Services, Project Lead.
- Peninah Orengo, Data Analyst, Projects Monitoring and Reporting, Research Assistant.

#### Expected Deliverables

- Algorithm predicting the most suitable locations for establishing plastic waste collection points.
- Algorithm predicting the most efficient routes for collecting plastic waste from collection points.
- Map showing the results of the algorithms

#### Mentors (This will be added by ABW Team)
