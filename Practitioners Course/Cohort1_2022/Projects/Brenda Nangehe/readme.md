## Digital learning reporting dashboard for course tracking and evaluation.

#### Background information
One of the Amref Health Africa Strategic Pillar is Human resources for health; to develop and sustain human resources for health (HRH) to catalyze the attainment of universal health coverage. The Strategic Objective is to increase the number and skills mix of mid-level and community-level health workers and Scaling up the use of digital learning approaches is a priority intervention.
We have implemented digital learning since 2005, where we used print-based material shared with the learners. In 2017 e-campus was established; a learning management solution for electronic and mobile learning and 2019 it was rebranded to Jibu.
Jibu is a digital learning and collaboration platform being used to build and strengthen Human Resources for Health across Africa. Currently, it has learners from over 36 African countries with over 60,000 users reached with capacity-building courses available in English, French and Portuguese on the platform. The courses are developed and are guided by policy and research in HRH and accessed via the internet browser or mobile app (for mobile phone users)
