## Operations Management Dashboard

The IFRC Americas office oversees various types of emergency operations in the region. Currently the GO Platform consolidates information on ongoing operations disaggregated by region, country and operation levels. However, it is difficult to integrate key performance indicators in one regional snapshot to make timely decisions at management level. The requested information from management usually involves getting a quick view on current capacity (response to previous or ongoing operations) and current or future hazards to impact the region with a heavy visual/geographic component.

#### Project Goal
The goal of the project is to develop an Operations Management Dashboard that aims at showcasing a regional view of ongoing operations, their key performance indicators, presence and capacity in the region, integrated to current hazards and potential operations to be developed. The main objective is to inform timely decision-making at management level. This dashboard must integrate existing components in the GO Platform such as Regional/operation pages, 3W, Risk Watch to be pulled through GO API.

##### The direct audience for this dashboard is the Operations Manager, Head of Disaster, Climate & Crisis: Prevention, Response and Recovery (DCCPRR), and other regional/subregional disaster management coordinators. 

Two main collaborators identified from the organization to support the project include:
- Paola Yela, Information Management and Data Science Officer, Geneva IM Team, Support on GO API usage
- Mar√≠a Tuna, Operations Manager, DCCPRR, Validate KPI and overall design an usage for dashboard

#### The final product is a dashboard to be updated automatically through the use of the GO API, ready to be used for management at Operations Monitoring meetings, at meetings with regional director, partners and communications to inform in any ongoing or predicted operations. A established support team and read me file to describe data flow and other relevant information.
