## Mapping Digital Divide in the Philippines for Community-Based Education Platform Strategy

### Background information
##### KadaKareer Background
- KadaKareer is a free low-bandwidth, community-based career development platform for underserved students in the Philippines launching their digital careers. KadaKareer’s platforms include Career Explorer and Coach Connector which allow students to learn about different careers while getting expert advice and support from Coaches in their fields of interest. To date, Kadakareer has engaged with 15k+ students and 40+ partners through our platform, webinars, and workshops. "Kada" comes from the word barkada, which means a group of friends. We are a Filipino student cheerleader, coach, and support group throughout their entire career journey!

##### KadaKareer: Education in the Philippines (snippets from the whitepaper below)
- According to UNESCO, the Philippines has one of the highest primary education enrollment and completion rates (~96% and ~84%
respectively). Unfortunately, these rates decline in secondary schools, then even further in tertiary schools. Though only 36% of all college-aged Filipinos end up matriculating, the number of HEIs in the Philippines is ten times more than in its neighboring countries. As of 2019, the Commission on Higher Education in the Philippines (CHED) reported that of the 1,963 HEIs in the country, 242 are public while 1,721 are private. Collectively, these HEIs serve about 3.2 million students, of which only around 750k actually graduate. This abysmal graduation rate indicates that there is something amiss about the higher education system that does not lend to student success. Evidently, there are severe gaps in tertiary education in the Philippines that have caused its perceived value to decline in the eyes of young Filipinos and their families. Specifically, there is a deep deficiency in how HEIs prepare students to enter the workforce, both in terms of career exploration and also skills development.

##### World Bank Report on Philippines Digital Economy Report: Digital Divide in Philippines (snippets from the whitepaper below)
- Despite the high internet usage, digital adoption in the Philippines generally trails behind many regional neighbors. Use of internet has expanded rapidly in the Philippines over the past decade. From 23 million in 2010, the number of Filipino internet users has more than tripled to 73 million in 2020. On average, every Filipino spends nearly 10 hours a day on the internet, the most worldwide, with over five hours on mobile internet, and nearly four hours on social media. In economic terms, the share of the value added of the Digital Economy to GDP, in constant prices, grew from 7 percent in 2012 to over 10 percent in 2018. During the same period, the value added of the digital economy posted double-digit annual growth averaging over 13 percent. Still, the World Bank Digital Adoption Index (DAI) and its three sub-indices on people, government and business, reveal that the Philippines falls behind regional peers when it comes to digital adoption. The size of e-commerce exemplifies the low levels of digital adoption. 

- This digital divide, between people with and without access to internet, contributes to unequal access to services that are delivered via the internet. For example, in 2016, the Department of Education found that around 74 percent of 46,700 public schools nationwide are unable to connect to internet facilities in their communities, despite having the budget allocation from the government (DepEd, 2016).25 About 70 percent or 34,500 of these schools without internet connectivity have electricity.26 One explanation for this is the lack of fixed infrastructure that is necessary to connect institutions or feed enough bandwidth to the mobile networks that reach those areas. Investment in fiber optic networks in the country is quite recent and there has been no massive effort to connect those outside the urban centers and high-income communities, unlike in other Asian countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam. Infrastructure sharing arrangements— which would lower the cost of fixed broadband deployment—are also not in place. This is discussed in more detail below. The Philippines is also on the wrong side of the regional ‘digital divide’. Compared to its middle-income ASEAN neighbors, fixed and mobile broadband internet penetration in the Philippines are relatively low. 

### Goal of the project
To map and visualize areas with no to slow internet in the Philippines in order to help students in their career exploration amidst the digital divide through community-based programs/platforms.
