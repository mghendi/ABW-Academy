## Realtime satellite-based monitoring system for Landscape restorations through AFOLU


#### Background information
Around the globe, organisations and governments are focusing on offsetting carbon through landscape-level restoration activities using trees as a component of the intervention. Although, impact measurement has always been a challenge for such activities.

Various tools have been developed to perform the desired task, but they are costlier when compared to the most critical component, i.e., growing trees.

With this, we wish to build a tool using KML Maps, which will assess the change in above-ground parameters and, based on certain algortihms, provide the intended results.

#### Goal of the project
To develop a model for performing need assessment, impact measurement, monitoring, verification and reporting of large scale landscape restoration activities using sentinel satellite imagery

#### Who will be using the results of this project and for making what decisions?
Large-scale restoration organisations, governments, Civil Society Organisations, CSRs, Carbon Offset Standards

Identify atleast 2 collaborators from your organization who will support you by providing
- Name, Title, Team, what is their persona for this project?

Durgesh Agrahari, Head - Programs and Partnerships
- Name, Title, Team, what is their persona for this project?

Mahidhar Reddy S, Head - Rural Programs

#### Expected Deliverables
Monitoring, reporting and verification system to assess above-ground parameters related to landscape restoration through tree plantation and watershed management.

#### Mentors (This will be added by ABW Team)
