## Project proposal for Analytics for better world

The project that I want to propose is to use data to determine whether rising incomes lead to increased consumption of unhealthy food and therefore, more health issues like diabetes around the world. I take inspiration from the case of India which saw an influx of increased disposable incomes post liberalisation in 1991. At the same time, there was also an influx of several western food chains and brands in the country, which were marketed to be very attractive. However, these disrupted traditional food eating habits of people and saw rising cases of diabetes and other heart related complications in the population, to the extent that India is now called the diabetes capital of the world. 

Using income data and food consumption basket data in a bunch of developed and developing countries and employing methods like difference in difference methods, I want to explore if the problem is indeed true and if there is a causation between the two. My main focus would be to study the situation is developed economies like US, UK and developing countries in Sub Saharan Africa and South Asia.
