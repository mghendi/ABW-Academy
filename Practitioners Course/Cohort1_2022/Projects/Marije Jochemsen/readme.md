## Reach analysis for Dutch districts

#### Background information
When emergencies occur in the Netherlands, the Red Cross can be called to action by the govermental regions to be present with a team of volunteers. Within each district, there is a pool of volunteers, team leads, and chauffeurs that can be paged when an emergency occurs. They will assemble at a certain location and will be picked up by the chauffeur with a Red Cross car to drive to the location. The Netherlands Red Cross aims to be present with this team within 45 minutes. 

Naturally, it is fairly difficult to determine which areas can be reached quickly by the RC, and which areas slowly. Therefore, there have been simulations for two district already to test how much time is needed for reaching all areas within the district, based on the addresses of the volunteers, the locations of the RC cars, and the assembly points.

#### Goal of the project
Based on the results of these simulations, an optimisation model can be build. For example, if a district wants to acquire a new car or a recruitment campaign for new volunteers will be initiated, it is useful to know what the optimal location is for cars, assembly points and volunteers. This project will aim to identify the needs of one or more districts in this regard, and will aim to enhance the reach of these volunteer teams from Netherlands Red Cross.

#### Who will be using the results of this project and for making what decisions?

Identify atleast 2 collaborators from your organization who will support you by providing
- Wessel de Jong, Data Analyst/Data Translator, Data&IM team. Wessel built the existing simulations and will be able to provide technical support, and an understanding of the simulations and results.
- A district manager that is yet to be identified: this person will provide contextual information for the specific use case.

#### Expected Deliverables
Ultimately, an optimisation model will be deployed that optimises for reach, based on the locations of volunteers, cars, and assembly points. Initially, this will be done for one district as a pilot.
