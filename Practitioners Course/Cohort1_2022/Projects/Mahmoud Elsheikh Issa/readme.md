## UNRWA Historic Archive Project Dashboard

#### Background information

It all started back in 1948. Palestine residents were forced out of their villages and had to seek refuge in nearby areas. As the events were folding the International Red Cross rushed to help the newly displaced refugees and started registering their data for the purpose of providing food and shelter. Then, in 1950, UNRWA - The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East was established. UNRWA kept on registering refugees infromation for the purpose of providing services including education, health, food, cash assistance and employment opportunities. Through out these years UNRWA had several registration systems that developed overtime. However, in 2010 when UNRWA upgraded to the current Refugee Registration Information System (RRIS), any refugee who was cancelled for death between 1948 and 2010 was not transferred to the new system. In the early 2000s UNRWA started the process of digitizing their records by scanning the physical documents and storing them on a server. In continuation for the previous efforts, the Historic Archive Project was launched in June 2021 as part of the RRIS Modernization Project. The main goal of the project is to transfer the missing records to the new system by re-instating their records with their relevant information. The project aims to rebuild the family trees and relinking family members back to their ancestors which preserves their rights as refugees and helps them connect better with their history. The UNRWA database has over 5.8 million records and some of these records have missing or wrong information, so another aspect of the project is cleaning the data and adding all NULL values.

#### Goal of the project

The Project works on a village by village basis, so creating a Power BI dashboard, that summarizes the status of each completed village is the main goal of my project.

#### Who will be using the results of this project and for making what decisions?

The dashboard would be used by the high level management as well as middle management to monitor the work progress and take the necessary decisions to improve the quality and pace of our work. The dashboad could also be maded available to the public for anyone who is interested to know more about the history of Palestine villages.
