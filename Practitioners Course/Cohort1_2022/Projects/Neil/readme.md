## Patterns in Public Services and Schemes Delivery in India

#### Background information

Typically, governments in India both at the union and the sub-national levels deliver multiple services and schemes to citizens in India. I want to create a tool to predict how effective this delivery system is by identifying patterns in who access these services and schemes, and what percentage of the addressable beneficiary market does the system effectively deliver the eligible services.

#### Goal of the project

This project aims at identifying patterns in delivery of schemes and services among beneficiaries.

#### Who will be using the results of this project and for making what decisions?

Identify atleast 2 collaborators from your organization who will support you by providing
