## Using Classified Proxy Means Testing scores to determine vulnerable households at a risk of realizing universal health coverage in select counties, Kenya

#### Background information
Kenya is currently operating in a devolved function where the County governments are responsible for the well-being of their populations. With the current economic frustrations, weak health systems, and national disasters such as climate change, the already poor and marginalized households are languishing at extreme poverty levels. The current situation is dire and possibly worsened by climate change presenting a colossal handle to the recently formed government. Climate change in all walks of life presents a problematic situation where county governments do not have transparent and gender lens systems to ensure that targetting of the poor is streamlined. Amref Health Innovations (AHI) had participated in such programs before, where household proxies were collected and used for identifying needy households for social programs. However, this has never been automated to serve other areas of interest, such as using Proxy Means Testing scores to realize Universal Health Coverage (UHC) for marginalized populations. Therefore, using a proxy means test, an index of observable and verifiable household characteristics that serve as a proxy for household welfare, there is, thus, a need to streamline the identification of the marginalized populations in our societies. This solution will adopt the Python programming language to create a poverty prediction model, including using business intelligence (BI) systems to demonstrate and estimate the risk of poor households. The BI will demonstrate levels of access to access health care services as recommended in our policies, where every household must be within a 5 km radius to access health services. In so doing, we have influenced policies and directives that will enable proper planning on locating health facilities while also putting the interest of the poor and marginalized households at heart. 

#### Goal of the project
The Goal of this project is to streamline and automate the prediction of households at risk of poverty. In addition, the project will also provide a linkage as to how we can use technology and other external sources of data to ensure there is equality in the distribution and strengthening of health systems. 

#### Who will be using the results of this project and for making what decisions?
The solution will target the county government leadership, non-governmental organizations and the departments of social protections to allow them make informed decisions when implementing safety net programes.
