## Sentiment around Oxfam Novib Brand

#### Background information
Oxfam Novib recently (2021) adopted a new brand identity, with overall narrative around equality. As part of the Oxfam Confederation, a global movement of people who are fighting inequality, we work with partner organizations across the globe to co-create a world that is fair, safe, equal and sustainable for everyone. Together we fight for equal rights for every person, no matter their gender, identity, ethnicity or skin color. 
In standing for equality, Oxfam Novib is increasingly becoming an influencing organisation, combining policy advocacy with public campaigning. This means our activities are increasingly exploiting the potential of (social) media. In this project, I aim to make use of the public available data created in media, specifically around our new brand identity.

#### Goal of the project
The objective of this project is to “listen” to how Oxfam Novib brand is perceived. 

Idea 1: We recently adopted a new brand identity and social media strategy, with focus on implementation at Instagram. I will dive into Instagram API and employ text mining techniques to 1) categorize and analyze the subject of conversation re: comments/engagements with our posts; and to 2) analyze the sentiment around Oxfam Novib brand. I will disaggregate the data by before/after new brand implementation, to see if topic of conversation/sentiment is changing (and if data allows to look into types of followers). This will give the brand team insights into our 'new followers' and how Oxfam Novib can keep growing its supporterbase.

Idea 2: I will dive into news articles (using https://www.gdeltproject.org/) and employ text mining techniques to 1) categorize and analyze the subject of conversation; and more importantly to 2) analyze the sentiment around Oxfam Novib brand. 

#### Who will be using the results of this project and for making what decisions?
As part of the ‘Engagement Research project’, I am working closely together with the Engagement unit on several research streams, of which brand research is one. This project will complement this regular (benchmarked) survey research around our brand. Specifically, it will inform the evaluation of the new brand campaign.

Collaborators:
-	Francisco Bolaños, Impact Measurement & Knowledge Specialist, Learning Innovation & Knowledge unit (he is my research peer in the Engagement Research project)
-	Laetitia Bosma, Brand & Digital Specialist within Engagement Unit (she is working on the implementation (and evaluation) of the new brand identity)

#### Expected Deliverables
A PowerPoint presentation with key pointers around how Oxfam Novib is visible in media, and sentiment around our new brand identity, as input for the brand campaign evaluation.
