## Making the data processing and visualization within Graduation Pilot Program in Mongolia
******* TO BE FILLED BEFORE November 04, 2022 ***********

#### Background information

     Commissioned by the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of Mongolia with technical and financial support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Mongolian Red Cross Society (MRCS) is currently implementing the Mongolian Graduation Pilot Program (MGPP) between June 2022 and December 2023. The pilot program will be implemented in the selected three districts of Ulaanbaatar.
    
    The graduation approach is an innovative welfare-based approach to social protection with comprehensive poverty reduction measures designed to address the multifaceted problem of poverty. This methodology is based on the understanding that the problem of multidimensional poverty cannot be completely solved by implementing only one type of measure (education, training, social welfare, etc.), and it has been proven that it is effective to implement comprehensive measures, for example, by combining cash assistance with other measures.

    This method was first initiated by BRAC in 2002 and has been adapted to various conditions in more than 75 countries. This program shows sustainable and beneficial results immediately after the event. The typical program components across different countries and contexts are:
      (i) social welfare transfers (cash or food) to help families meet their immediate consumption needs;
      (ii) an asset transfer selected by the beneficiary from a list of options, based on a detailed local market assessment and value chain analysis;
      (iii) focused technical and business skills training to develop the capacity to turn the asset into a productive enterprise;
      (iv) financial literacy training and financial inclusion; and
      (v) regular coaching and mentoring by a trained facilitator or social worker
      
    The Graduation Pilot Program will support 1,520 working-age adults aged 16–55 in poor households to build on cash transfers to provide holistic support that leads to economic inclusion, diversified livelihoods, and poverty reduction. The pilot will be implemented in three districts of Ulaanbaatar, selected for their high concentration of poor and vulnerable households: Bayanzurkh, Chingeltei, and Songinokhairkhan between June 2022 and December 2023.
    
    Currently, the Household verification survey to select the target households has been conducted and a total of 4088 households' data has been collected through the household visit by trained field coaches/enumerators. Currently, a total of 3627 households met the household selection criteria. A randomized selection method will be utilized to select the target 1520 households as well as 1520 control households. 
    
    There are big data of 3627 households available to make data processing, analysis, and visualization for further project implementation. 


#### Goal of the project

To determine and apply methods that could further process through working on the Big data of the Household Verification Survey of the Graduation Pilot Program and performing analysis and data visualization on the data;

#### Who will be using the results of this project and for making what decisions?

The Graduation Pilot Program Team - the data analysis and visualisation will support us to understand the current context and the situation of the households and basic of the program implementation. Also, the processed data will influence to the program direction and focus. For example, based on the experience and interest of the household, what type of Livelihood training should be organized in the future or determining what type of information to provide to the household based on the environment of the household, etc.

The Graduation Pilot Program Unit both at the Asian Development Bank and the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection - This current program is a pilot program implemented for the first time in Mongolia, and based on the context of Mongolia, a model of the program will be developed and implemented in other districts and provinces. If the methodology/approach used in this project is tested well, it will be used as a model program in the future.
