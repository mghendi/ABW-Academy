There is a lot of work that has been done around modelling factors influencing vulnerability of households 
to  flood  risk  but  none  of  the  works(model  results  )  or  recommendations  are      easily  accessible  to  users 
through a simple web interface . 
This project therefore aims towards bridging this gap of information access to targetted users to provide easy 
to use and highly interactive interface to users to be able to quickly 

- Assess level of vulnearbility of households and therefore able to estimate population at risk of floods. 
- In  future  the  tool  can  be  enhanced  by  triangulating  it  with  other  data  sources  such  as  level  of 
vulnerability  to floods and risk of snake bites (which currently is a grey research area /gap) 
 
Project descripition and Background 
What the project is about: 
The project aims to create a web app for a model to predict vulnearbility of households to flood risks . 
The  web  app  will  be  built  using  dash  and  plotly  frameworks  to  provide  an  easy  to  use    interface  to 
stakeholders . 
Currently there is very limited and interactive tools for predicting households vulnerability to floods. 
Users targetted: 
The tool targets to  help  community  based  organizations  ,civil  society  and  county  governments  working  on 
flood risk mitigation.
